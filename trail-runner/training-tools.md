## Elevation Training Tools

Can't hit the trails today? Use these converters and tools to replicate elevation training indoors — on a treadmill, stair climber, or with bodyweight exercises.

### EG Converter (Elevation Gain Equivalent)

Convert outdoor elevation gain targets into equivalent indoor workouts:

- **Treadmill Incline** — Calculate the time and incline % needed to match a specific elevation gain
- **Stair Climber** — Convert elevation gain to floors or steps at your machine's settings
- **Step-Ups** — How many step-ups on a box to replicate a climb
- **Stadium Stairs** — Equivalent stadium stair laps for your target vert

### Indoor Training Equivalents

| Outdoor Activity | Indoor Equivalent | Key Settings |
|---|---|---|
| Mountain climb (steep) | Treadmill at 12-15% | Walk/hike pace |
| Rolling hills | Treadmill at 6-10% | Easy run pace |
| Long gradual ascent | Stair climber level 8-12 | Steady state |
| Technical uphill | Single-leg chair raise | Controlled tempo |
| Downhill training | Eccentric squats | Slow negative phase |

### Specific Tools

- **Single-Leg Chair Raise** — Builds single-leg power for steep uphill running. Replicate trail-specific quad and glute engagement.
- **Treadmill Hill Repeats** — Structured incline intervals to build climbing endurance.
- **Stair Climber Workouts** — Sustained vert-building sessions with heart rate targets.
- **Eccentric Quad Loading** — Prepare your quads for punishing descents.
