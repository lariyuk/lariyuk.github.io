## Trail Route Planning

Design trail runs with full topographic context — overlay elevation contours, mark technical sections, and plan aid points for self-supported runs.

### Planner Features

- **Topographic Map Overlay** — See contour lines and terrain features
- **Trail Database Integration** — Snap to known trails and connectors
- **Waypoint Markers** — Mark water sources, bail-out points, and aid stations
- **Terrain Tags** — Label technical, rocky, muddy, or exposed sections
- **Elevation Profile** — Visualize climbs, descents, and grade percentages
- **Distance & Vert Calculator** — Total distance and elevation gain at a glance
- **GPX Export** — Download routes for GPS watches and navigation apps

### Planning for Safety

- Always mark alternative exit routes
- Note stream crossings and seasonal flood risks
- Check for hunting seasons or trail closures
- Share your planned route with an emergency contact
- Estimate realistic completion times including hiking sections
