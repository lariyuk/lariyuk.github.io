## Elevation Maps & Profiles

Visualize the vertical challenge of any trail — interactive elevation profiles, gradient analysis, and 3D terrain views to prepare for every climb and descent.

### Elevation Profile Features

- **Interactive Chart** — Hover to see elevation, distance, and grade at any point
- **Climb Categorization** — Climbs rated by length, gradient, and total gain
- **Gradient Coloring** — Visual heat map of steep vs. flat sections
- **Split Analysis** — Mile-by-mile or km-by-km elevation breakdown
- **Comparison Mode** — Overlay multiple routes to compare vertical profiles

### 3D Terrain View

- Rotate and zoom a 3D model of the trail and surrounding terrain
- Toggle satellite imagery for land cover context
- Identify ridgelines, valleys, and exposed sections
- View shade analysis based on time of day

### Elevation Statistics
