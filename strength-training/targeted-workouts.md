## Targeted Specific Workouts

Goal-driven workout programs designed for specific outcomes — whether you're training for hypertrophy, raw strength, endurance, or injury rehabilitation.

### Workout by Goal

- **Hypertrophy (Muscle Growth)** — High volume, time-under-tension, progressive overload
- **Strength (Max Power)** — Low reps, heavy loads, CNS-focused programming
- **Muscular Endurance** — High rep ranges, circuit training, sustained effort
- **Power & Explosiveness** — Olympic lifts, plyometrics, speed work
- **Rehabilitation** — Post-injury protocols for common running and lifting injuries
- **Prehabilitation** — Preventive exercises to avoid common injuries

### Specialty Programs

- **Runner's Strength** — Strength work specifically designed for road and trail runners
- **Desk Worker Fix** — Target postural imbalances from sitting all day
- **Upper/Lower Split** — Classic 4-day split for balanced development
- **Push/Pull/Legs** — 6-day training split for maximum frequency
- **Full Body 3x/Week** — Efficient total-body programs for busy schedules

### Program Structure

Each program includes:
- Weekly schedule and session breakdown
- Exercise selection with sets, reps, rest periods
- Progression model (how to increase difficulty over time)
- Deload protocols for recovery weeks
